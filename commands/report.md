# /report — Reporting Router

> **ROUTER DIRECTIVE**: Analyze reporting needs and route to appropriate reporting workflow.
>
> **MULTI-PURPOSE**: Report supports any topic and three output modes — create new report, update existing files, or generate from user template/format.

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS EXECUTION)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md
2. ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md
3. EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

**⛔ Do not run any workflow phase until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files. Then run this file's ROUTING LOGIC, LOAD the chosen variant workflow, and execute it.

## OUTPUT MODES (infer from user request)

Reporter **infers** the mode from what the user asks for — no fixed phrase list. Choose by **intent**:

| Mode | User intent | Reporter action |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Create report** | User wants a **new** deliverable (report, summary, analysis, documentation). | Scout/synthesize → write **new** file under `./reports/` or path user specifies. |
| **Update existing** | User wants **changes reflected in existing** files (docs, README, specs, etc.). | Scout → identify related files → **edit** those files. Do not create a new report unless also asked. |
| **From template** | User provides a **format, template, or structure** to follow. | Use that format/structure → generate file(s) matching it (e.g. after scouting source). |

**Topic-agnostic**: Subject is whatever the user asks for — infer from the request; not limited to status or technical only.

## ROUTING LOGIC

```
IF task is simple status update OR summary:
  → Route to /report:fast

IF task is comprehensive analysis OR deep dive OR any non-trivial topic (infer from request):
  → Route to /report:hard

IF task requires absolute context clarity OR "clean slate" analysis:
  → Route to /report:focus

IF user explicitly asks to UPDATE existing files (not create report):
  → Still use /report:hard or /report:focus; reporter OUTPUT MODE = update existing files

IF unsure:
  → Default to /report:fast (escalate if needed)
```
