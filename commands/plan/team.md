# /plan:team — Golden Triangle Planning & Architecture

> **MISSION**: Maximum quality technical planning through adversarial collaboration.
> Each phase spawns a **Golden Triangle** of 3 agents: Tech Lead (coordinator),
> Executor (implementer), Reviewer (devil's advocate). Output is released ONLY
> upon consensus after debate.

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution
4. **TEAMS.md** — Golden Triangle protocol (MANDATORY)

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

**Skills Resolution**: Load `SKILLS.md` on-demand for fitness calculation and dynamic discovery.

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

> Reference: AGENTS.md (Tiered Execution) + TEAMS.md (Golden Triangle Protocol)

| Tier       | When                          | Action                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent/Agent Tool EXISTS | Orchestrator spawns Tech Lead → Tech Lead spawns Executor + Reviewer      |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING or SYSTEM error  | EMBODY Tech Lead → EMBODY Executor → EMBODY Reviewer → EMBODY Tech Lead  |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

**TIER 2 Golden Triangle Embodiment** (per TEAMS.md):
```
1. EMBODY Tech Lead → decompose task → produce Shared Task List → dispatch
2. EMBODY Executor → execute assigned tasks → post SUBMISSION to Mailbox
3. EMBODY Reviewer → review submissions → post REVIEW to Mailbox
4. IF FAIL → EMBODY Executor again → fix/defend → EMBODY Reviewer → re-check
5. Repeat steps 3–4 max 3 rounds
6. EMBODY Tech Lead → arbitrate if needed → post DECISION → synthesize output
```

## 🔗 PHASE DEPENDENCIES

| Phase                           | Requires                          | Blocking    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| P1: Requirements Discovery      | User request                      | No          |
| P2: Architecture & Research     | P1 requirements + codebase map    | **YES**     |
| P3: Plan Creation               | RESEARCH + ADRs + SCOUT           | **YES**     |
| P4: Review & Finalization       | **PLAN file(s)**                  | **YES**     |

**⛔ Blocking**: If input missing → STOP → Create it first → Resume

---

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time. Within each phase follow the Golden Triangle Loop below.

**Consensus Stamp Format** (required to close each phase):
```
✅ CONSENSUS: {TechLead} ✓ | {Executor} ✓ | {Reviewer} ✓
```

---

## 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE LOOP — Universal Protocol

> Every phase below follows this exact loop. Deviations are PROHIBITED.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Tech Lead decomposes phase goal → Shared Task List → Mailbox    │
│  2. Executor works each task → SUBMISSION to Mailbox                │
│  3. Reviewer reviews → REVIEW (PASS/FAIL) to Mailbox               │
│  4. IF FAIL (max 3 rounds): Fix or DEFENSE → re-review             │
│     → After 3 rounds → ESCALATION to Tech Lead                     │
│  5. IF PASS: APPROVAL → task ✅                                     │
│  6. All tasks done → Tech Lead verifies → DECISION + consensus      │
│  OUTPUT: ✅ CONSENSUS: TechLead ✓ | Executor ✓ | Reviewer ✓        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🎭 Phase 1: REQUIREMENTS DISCOVERY — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `researcher`                         | Decompose: requirement areas, stakeholder analysis, scope boundaries |
| Executor  | `scouter` + `business-analyst`       | Execute: codebase analysis, business requirements extraction |
| Reviewer  | `brainstormer` (Devil's Advocate)    | Challenge: missed requirements, unstated assumptions |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `researcher` decomposes into: functional reqs, non-functional reqs, codebase context, stakeholder needs → TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox
2. `scouter` surveys codebase → posts SUBMISSION: architecture map, dependency graph, existing patterns, constraints
3. `business-analyst` extracts business reqs → posts SUBMISSION: user stories, business rules, priorities, success metrics
4. `brainstormer` reviews EACH SUBMISSION → posts REVIEW:
   - Requirements complete? Edge cases missed? Assumptions validated?
   - Conflicting requirements? Adversarial scenarios?
5. If FAIL → executors address gaps or defend → RESUBMISSION/DEFENSE → max 3 rounds
6. `researcher` synthesizes all approved findings into unified artifacts

**Deliverable**: `./reports/brainstorms/BRAINSTORM-{task}.md` + `./reports/scouts/SCOUT-{task}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: All requirements captured, codebase mapped, business context validated, assumptions challenged
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: researcher ✓ | scouter+business-analyst ✓ | brainstormer ✓

## 🎭 Phase 2: ARCHITECTURE & RESEARCH — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tech-lead`                          | Decompose: architecture decisions, pattern selection |
| Executor  | `researcher`                         | Execute: research patterns, evaluate technologies, draft ADRs |
| Reviewer  | `reviewer` (feasibility critic)      | Challenge: over-engineering, complexity, scalability concerns |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** BRAINSTORM + SCOUT files from Phase 1.

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `tech-lead` reads Phase 1 artifacts → decomposes: pattern selection, tech evaluation, data model, API contracts, NFR architecture → TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox
2. `researcher` deep-dives each area → posts SUBMISSION: trade-off matrix, evaluation pros/cons, draft ADR per decision, evidence (benchmarks, case studies)
3. `reviewer` reviews with feasibility lens → posts REVIEW:
   - Does this pattern fit our codebase? Complexity justified?
   - Simpler alternatives? Maintenance burden? Evidence-backed?
4. Debate loop if FAIL → `researcher` defends or pivots → max 3 rounds
5. `tech-lead` arbitrates disputes → DECISION → synthesizes deliverables

**CONSTRAINT INHERITANCE**: Architecture decisions MUST reference Phase 1 ("Based on requirement R1...", "Codebase constraint from SCOUT...", "Business rule from BA...")

**Deliverable**: `./reports/researchers/RESEARCH-{task}.md` + `./reports/designs/ADR-{task}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: Patterns researched, alternatives documented, ADRs drafted, feasibility validated
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tech-lead ✓ | researcher ✓ | reviewer ✓

| Role      | Agent                                         | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `planner`                                     | Decompose: plan structure, task breakdown, dependencies |
| Executor  | `planner` (self-implements)                   | Execute: write detailed PLAN-{task}.md |
| Reviewer  | `tech-lead` + `security-engineer` lens        | Challenge: missing tasks, wrong estimates, security gaps, unfeasible steps |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** BRAINSTORM + SCOUT + RESEARCH + ADR files from Phases 1–2.

### PLAN QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (ENFORCED BY REVIEWER)

```
1. Every task MUST trace to a requirement or ADR — orphans = automatic FAIL
2. Every external input path must have validation planned
3. Every phase must have a rollback strategy
4. Deviations from prior phase findings require explicit justification
```

**Deliverable**: `./reports/plans/PLAN-{task}.md` (single) or `PLAN-{task}-phase1.md`, … (multi-phase)
**Exit Criteria**: Plan complete, all sections reviewed, security validated, estimates challenged, traceability verified
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: planner ✓ | planner(exec) ✓ | tech-lead+security ✓

## 🎭 Phase 4: REVIEW & FINALIZATION — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tech-lead`                          | Final review, integration check |
| Executor  | `reviewer`                           | Execute: comprehensive plan review |
| Reviewer  | `business-analyst`                   | Challenge: business alignment, acceptance criteria coverage |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** PLAN file(s) + all Phase 1–2 artifacts.

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `tech-lead` decomposes into: technical coherence, cross-phase traceability, risk adequacy, testability → TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox
2. `reviewer` audits plan → posts SUBMISSION: structure assessment, completeness vs Phase 1 reqs, ADR alignment, security posture, executability score
3. `business-analyst` reviews with business lens → posts REVIEW:
   - Acceptance criteria cover all business requirements?
   - Success metrics testable? Priority aligned with value?
   - Stakeholders would approve as-is?
4. Debate loop if FAIL → `reviewer` addresses gaps or defends → max 3 rounds
5. `tech-lead` synthesizes final validation report

**FINAL QUALITY GATE**:
```
FOR EACH requirement in BRAINSTORM-{task}.md:
  → reviewer: Verify ≥1 plan task addresses this requirement
  → business-analyst: Confirm AC matches business intent
  → Document: "REQ-{id} → Task: {ref} → AC: {criteria} → ✓/✗"
```

**Deliverable**: `./reports/qa/QA-PLAN-{task}.md` — includes: PASS/REVISE verdict, traceability matrix, security summary, business confirmation
**Exit Criteria**: Plan validated, technically coherent, security reviewed, business-aligned
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tech-lead ✓ | reviewer ✓ | business-analyst ✓

**⚠️ IF VERDICT = NEEDS REVISION:**
```
1. QA-PLAN lists specific amendments
2. RETURN to Phase 3 → planner addresses amendments
3. RE-RUN Phase 4 → max 2 revision cycles → then escalate to user
```
