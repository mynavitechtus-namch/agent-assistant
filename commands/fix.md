# /fix — Issue Resolution Router

> **ROUTER DIRECTIVE**: Analyze issue complexity and route to appropriate fix workflow.

<issue>$ARGUMENTS</issue>

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS EXECUTION)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution

**⛔ Do not run any workflow phase until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files. Then run this file's ROUTING LOGIC, LOAD the chosen variant workflow, and execute it.

---

## ROUTING LOGIC

```
IF issue is simple (clear cause, quick fix):
  → Route to /fix:fast

IF issue is complex (research needed, multi-file):
  → Route to /fix:hard

IF issue is complex AND context optimization is critical:
  → Route to /fix:focus

IF issue is complex AND maximum quality with team collaboration needed:
  → Route to /fix:team

IF unsure:
  → Default to /fix:fast (escalate if needed)
```
