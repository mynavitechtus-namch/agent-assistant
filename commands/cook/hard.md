# /cook:hard — Complete Feature Development

> **MISSION**: Full feature development with research, design, planning, implementation, validation.

<feature>$ARGUMENTS</feature>

---

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

**Skills Resolution**: When delegating, load `SKILLS.md` on-demand for fitness calculation and dynamic discovery (hard/focus variants enable find-skills).

---

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

> Reference: AGENTS.md (Tiered Execution)`

| Tier       | When                          | Action                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent/Agent Tool EXISTS | Invoke sub-agent (MANDATORY) |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING or SYSTEM error  | EMBODY agent file (FALLBACK) |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

## 📁 DELIVERABLE FILES

| Agent        | Output                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| brainstormer | `./reports/{topic}/brainstorms/BRAINSTORM-{feature}` |
| researcher   | `./reports/{topic}/researchers/RESEARCH-{feature}`   |
| scouter      | `./reports/{topic}/scouts/SCOUT-{feature}`           |
| designer     | `./reports/{topic}/designs/DESIGN-{feature}`         |
| planner      | `./reports/{topic}/plans/PLAN-{feature}`             |

All files in `./reports/{topic}/` → English only.
**⚠️ Paths above = base names.** Small (≤ 150 lines) → create as `{name}.md`. Large (> 150 lines or ≥ 4 sections) → create as `{name}/` folder with `00-index.md` + `01-*.md`, `02-*.md` section files.

## 🔗 PHASE DEPENDENCIES

| Phase              | Requires               | Blocking    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| P1: Brainstorm     | User request           | No          |
| P2: Research       | User request           | No          |
| P3: Scout          | User request           | No          |
| P3.5: DB Design    | Data requirements      | Conditional |
| P4: Design         | Scout findings         | Conditional |
| P5: Planning       | RESEARCH + SCOUT files | **YES**     |
| P6: Implementation | **PLAN file**          | **YES**     |
| P7: Testing        | PLAN + Code            | **YES**     |
| P8: Review         | PLAN + Code + Tests    | **YES**     |

**⛔ Blocking**: If input missing → STOP → Create it first → Resume

---

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time, each phase independent: Phase 1 → then Phase 2 → … in one reply. No batching (load only what each phase needs). **Within each phase:** when doing a part, output it in format so user sees what’s happening (announce before doing). Format: rules/PHASES.md § Phase output structure.

---
