# /cook:team — Golden Triangle Feature Development

> **MISSION**: Maximum quality feature development through adversarial collaboration.
> Each phase spawns a **Golden Triangle** of 3 agents: Tech Lead (coordinator),
> Executor (implementer), Reviewer (devil's advocate). Output is released ONLY
> upon consensus after debate.

<feature>$ARGUMENTS</feature>

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution
4. **TEAMS.md** — Golden Triangle protocol (MANDATORY)

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

**Skills Resolution**: Load `SKILLS.md` on-demand for fitness calculation and dynamic discovery.

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

> Reference: AGENTS.md (Tiered Execution) + TEAMS.md (Golden Triangle Protocol)

| Tier       | When                          | Action                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent/Agent Tool EXISTS | Orchestrator spawns Tech Lead → Tech Lead spawns Executor + Reviewer      |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING or SYSTEM error  | EMBODY Tech Lead → EMBODY Executor → EMBODY Reviewer → EMBODY Tech Lead  |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

**TIER 2 Golden Triangle Embodiment** (per TEAMS.md):
```
1. EMBODY Tech Lead → decompose task → produce Shared Task List → dispatch
2. EMBODY Executor → implement assigned tasks → post SUBMISSION to Mailbox
3. EMBODY Reviewer → review submissions → post REVIEW to Mailbox
4. IF FAIL → EMBODY Executor again → fix/defend → EMBODY Reviewer → re-check
5. Repeat steps 3–4 max 3 rounds
6. EMBODY Tech Lead → arbitrate if needed → post DECISION → synthesize output
```

| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `researcher`                         | Decompose: requirements gathering, codebase survey, prior art |
| Executor  | `scouter`                            | Execute: deep codebase analysis, map architecture, identify integration points |
| Reviewer  | `brainstormer` (Devil's Advocate)    | Challenge: poke holes in findings, identify missed requirements, question assumptions |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `researcher` decomposes discovery into areas: functional requirements, non-functional requirements, codebase context, prior art
2. `researcher` posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox for each area → dispatches to `scouter`
3. `scouter` surveys codebase deeply → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox with findings per area
4. `brainstormer` reviews each SUBMISSION → posts REVIEW to Mailbox:
   - Are requirements complete? Any edge cases missed?
   - Are assumptions validated or just guesses?
   - What user scenarios are unaccounted for?
5. If REVIEW = FAIL → `scouter` addresses gaps or defends findings → posts RESUBMISSION/DEFENSE
6. `brainstormer` re-reviews → max 3 rounds → ESCALATION to `researcher` if unresolved
7. `researcher` synthesizes all approved findings into unified requirements document

**Deliverable**: Requirements + discovery report in `./reports/brainstorms/BRAINSTORM-{feature}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: All requirements captured, codebase understood, gaps identified, assumptions challenged
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: researcher ✓ | scouter ✓ | brainstormer ✓

| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `researcher`                         | Decompose: pattern research areas, technology evaluation criteria |
| Executor  | `researcher` (self-executes research)| Execute: deep-dive patterns, libraries, best practices, alternatives |
| Reviewer  | `tech-lead` (feasibility critic)     | Challenge: assess feasibility, question complexity, verify patterns fit existing codebase |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `researcher` (as Tech Lead) identifies research areas → Shared Task List → Mailbox
2. `researcher` (as Executor) deep-dives each area → posts SUBMISSION with findings, comparisons, trade-offs
3. `tech-lead` reviews each research finding → posts REVIEW:
   - Does this pattern actually fit our codebase?
   - Is the complexity justified for our scale?
   - Are there simpler alternatives overlooked?
   - Will this introduce maintenance burden?
4. Debate loop if FAIL → `researcher` defends or pivots → max 3 rounds
5. `researcher` (as Tech Lead) synthesizes approved research into final deliverables

**Deliverable**: `./reports/researchers/RESEARCH-{feature}.md` + `./reports/scouts/SCOUT-{feature}.md`

| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `designer`                           | Decompose: UI components, interaction flows, design system tokens |
| Executor  | `frontend-engineer`                  | Execute: create design specs, component structures, responsive layouts |
| Reviewer  | `reviewer` + UX/accessibility lens   | Challenge: accessibility issues, UX friction, design inconsistencies, mobile gaps |

**Triangle Loop**:

| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `planner`                            | Decompose: plan creation with all dependencies, task ordering, effort estimation |
| Executor  | `researcher`                         | Execute: fill knowledge gaps, validate approaches, draft plan sections |
| Reviewer  | `tech-lead` (feasibility critic)     | Challenge: question estimates, find risks, verify technical approach is sound |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** RESEARCH + SCOUT + DESIGN files before starting.

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `planner` reads all prior deliverables → decomposes plan into sections → Shared Task List → TASK_ASSIGNMENT

### STRICT PLAN ADHERENCE (ENFORCED BY REVIEWER)

```
1. READ PLAN FIRST — every task MUST trace to a plan step
2. IF step seems wrong → STOP → Executor posts ESCALATION to Mailbox
   → Tech Lead evaluates → Request Re-Planning or Override
3. NO unauthorized deviations — Reviewer explicitly checks for this:
   "Does this SUBMISSION match the plan step? Any additions not in plan?"
4. Deviations found by Reviewer → automatic FAIL with:
   Severity: CRITICAL | Action: "Remove unauthorized code or get plan amended"
```

**Exit Criteria**: All plan tasks implemented, all reviews passed, no unauthorized deviations, integration verified
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tech-lead ✓ | {executor} ✓ | reviewer ✓

## 🎭 Phase 7: TESTING & REVIEW — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                           | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tester`                                        | Decompose: test strategy, coverage targets, acceptance verification plan |
| Executor  | `tester` (self-implements tests)                | Execute: write tests, run tests, generate coverage report  |
| Reviewer  | `reviewer` + security/performance combined lens | Challenge: test gaps, missing security tests, perf benchmarks not met |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `tester` (as Tech Lead) reads PLAN + implementation → decomposes into test strategy:
   - Unit tests per module
   - Integration tests per API endpoint
   - E2E tests per user flow
   - Security test cases (injection, auth bypass, IDOR)
   - Performance baseline assertions
2. `tester` (as Tech Lead) posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox with test plan
3. `tester` (as Executor) writes and runs tests → posts SUBMISSION per test category:
   - Tests written (file list)
   - Tests passed / failed
   - Coverage percentage
   - Plan checkpoint verification results
4. `reviewer` reviews test submissions with combined security + performance lens → posts REVIEW:
   - Coverage sufficient? Any untested critical paths?
   - Security test cases: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, auth bypass covered?
   - Performance assertions: response time, memory, query count baselines?
   - Plan acceptance criteria: every criterion has a corresponding test?
5. Debate loop if FAIL → fix gaps or defend → max 3 rounds
6. `tester` (as Tech Lead) synthesizes final QA report

**PLAN CHECKPOINT VERIFICATION** (MANDATORY):
```
FOR EACH acceptance criterion in PLAN-{feature}.md:
  → tester: Write test that specifically verifies this criterion
  → reviewer: Confirm test actually validates the criterion (not a trivial pass)
  → Document: "AC-{id} → Test: {test name} → Verified: {pass/fail}"
```

**Deliverable**: Test results + coverage report + QA summary
**Exit Criteria**: All tests pass, coverage meets threshold, security validated, performance acceptable, all plan acceptance criteria verified
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tester ✓ | tester(exec) ✓ | reviewer ✓
