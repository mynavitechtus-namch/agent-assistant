# /code:team — Golden Triangle Code Implementation

> **MISSION**: Maximum quality code implementation through adversarial collaboration.
> Each phase spawns a **Golden Triangle** of 3 agents: Tech Lead (coordinator),
> Executor (implementer), Reviewer (devil's advocate). Output is released ONLY
> upon consensus after debate.
>
> **KEY DIFFERENCE FROM /cook:team**: No research, no design, no planning phases.
> Pure coding: scope → implement → verify. Use when you know WHAT to build and just need it BUILT RIGHT.

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution
4. **TEAMS.md** — Golden Triangle protocol (MANDATORY)

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

**Skills Resolution**: Load `SKILLS.md` on-demand for fitness calculation and dynamic discovery.

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

> Reference: AGENTS.md (Tiered Execution) + TEAMS.md (Golden Triangle Protocol)

| Tier       | When                          | Action                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent/Agent Tool EXISTS | Orchestrator spawns Tech Lead → Tech Lead spawns Executor + Reviewer      |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING or SYSTEM error  | EMBODY Tech Lead → EMBODY Executor → EMBODY Reviewer → EMBODY Tech Lead  |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

**TIER 2 Golden Triangle Embodiment** (per TEAMS.md):
```
1. EMBODY Tech Lead → decompose task → produce Shared Task List → dispatch
2. EMBODY Executor → implement assigned tasks → post SUBMISSION to Mailbox
3. EMBODY Reviewer → review submissions → post REVIEW to Mailbox
4. IF FAIL → EMBODY Executor again → fix/defend → EMBODY Reviewer → re-check
5. Repeat steps 3–4 max 3 rounds
6. EMBODY Tech Lead → arbitrate if needed → post DECISION → synthesize output
```

## 🔗 PHASE DEPENDENCIES

| Phase                     | Requires                         | Blocking    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| P1: Scope Analysis        | User request                     | No          |
| P2: Implementation        | Scope + Task List from P1        | **YES**     |
| P3: Verification          | Code changes from P2             | **YES**     |

**⛔ Blocking**: If input missing → STOP → Create it first → Resume

---

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time. Within each phase:

```
1. Spawn Golden Triangle (Tech Lead + Executor + Reviewer)
2. Tech Lead decomposes → publishes Shared Task List
3. Executor implements → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox
4. Reviewer critiques → posts REVIEW to Mailbox
5. Debate loop: fix/defend → re-review (max 3 rounds)
6. Consensus reached → Tech Lead posts DECISION → Phase output released
```

**Consensus Stamp Format** (required to close each phase):
```
✅ CONSENSUS: {TechLead} ✓ | {Executor} ✓ | {Reviewer} ✓
```

Format: rules/PHASES.md § Phase output structure + rules/TEAMS.md § Golden Triangle Phase Output Format.

## 🎭 Phase 1: SCOPE ANALYSIS — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tech-lead`                          | Decompose: analyze scope, identify affected files, define task list |
| Executor  | `scouter`                            | Execute: scan codebase, map dependencies, identify integration points |
| Reviewer  | `reviewer` (Devil's Advocate)        | Challenge: scope correct? Missing dependencies? Breaking changes? |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `tech-lead` reads user request → decomposes into scope areas: affected modules, files to change, dependencies, risks
2. `tech-lead` posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox → dispatches to `scouter`
3. `scouter` scans codebase deeply → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox with:
   - Files to create/modify (exact paths)
   - Dependency map (what depends on what)
   - Integration points (APIs, imports, shared state)
   - Existing patterns to follow
   - Potential side effects
4. `reviewer` reviews SUBMISSION → posts REVIEW to Mailbox:
   - Is the scope complete or are files missing?
   - Are there hidden dependencies not mapped?
   - Will these changes break existing functionality?
   - Are there cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, error handling)?
5. If REVIEW = FAIL → `scouter` addresses gaps or defends → posts RESUBMISSION/DEFENSE
6. `reviewer` re-reviews → max 3 rounds → ESCALATION to `tech-lead` if unresolved
7. `tech-lead` synthesizes into final Shared Task List for Phase 2

**Deliverable**: Scoped task list with affected files, dependencies, and integration points
**Exit Criteria**: All affected files identified, dependencies mapped, risks surfaced, task list ready
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tech-lead ✓ | scouter ✓ | reviewer ✓

## 🎭 Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

> **THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL PHASE.** Every step is detailed. No shortcuts.

### Team Selection

```
IF fullstack (frontend + backend changes) →
  Tech Lead: tech-lead
  Executor: backend-engineer (then frontend-engineer, sequential)
  Reviewer: reviewer

IF backend-only →
  Tech Lead: tech-lead
  Executor: backend-engineer
  Reviewer: reviewer

IF frontend-only →
  Tech Lead: tech-lead
  Executor: frontend-engineer
  Reviewer: reviewer

IF game development →
  Tech Lead: tech-lead
  Executor: game-engineer
  Reviewer: reviewer

IF mobile development →
  Tech Lead: tech-lead
  Executor: mobile-engineer
  Reviewer: reviewer

IF other domain → Consult TEAMS.md roster for correct triangle
```

| Role      | Agent                                    | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tech-lead`                              | Load scope → decompose into coding tasks → coordinate all work |
| Executor  | `backend-engineer` / `frontend-engineer` / `game-engineer` / `mobile-engineer` | Implement code changes → submit via Mailbox |
| Reviewer  | `reviewer`                               | Review EVERY submission: correctness, security, performance, style |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** Phase 1 scope output (task list + dependency map) before starting.

### SCOPE ADHERENCE (ENFORCED BY REVIEWER)

```
1. READ SCOPE FIRST — every task MUST trace to Phase 1 scope
2. IF task seems wrong → STOP → Executor posts ESCALATION to Mailbox
   → Tech Lead evaluates → Re-scope or Override
3. NO scope creep — Reviewer explicitly checks for this:
   "Does this SUBMISSION stay within scoped changes? Any additions not in scope?"
4. Scope creep found by Reviewer → automatic FAIL with:
   Severity: CRITICAL | Action: "Remove out-of-scope code or get scope amended"
```

**Exit Criteria**: All scoped tasks implemented, all reviews passed, no unauthorized scope creep, integration verified
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tech-lead ✓ | {executor} ✓ | reviewer ✓

## 🎭 Phase 3: VERIFICATION — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                        | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tester`                                     | Decompose: verification strategy, test what was changed    |
| Executor  | `tester` (self-implements tests)             | Execute: write tests, run tests, generate coverage report  |
| Reviewer  | `security-engineer`                          | Challenge: edge cases, regressions, security implications  |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `tester` (as Tech Lead) reads Phase 2 implementation output → decomposes verification into:
   - Unit tests for changed/new functions
   - Integration tests for affected endpoints or modules
   - Regression checks for dependent code
   - Edge case validation
2. `tester` (as Tech Lead) posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox with test plan
3. `tester` (as Executor) writes and runs tests → posts SUBMISSION per test category:
   - Tests written (file list)
   - Tests passed / failed
   - Coverage percentage for changed files
   - Edge cases validated
4. `security-engineer` reviews test submissions → posts REVIEW:
   - Are security-sensitive paths tested (auth, input validation, injection)?
   - Are edge cases truly edge cases or happy paths in disguise?
   - Are there regression risks in dependent code not covered?
   - Are error paths and failure modes tested?
5. Debate loop if FAIL → `tester` fixes gaps or defends → max 3 rounds
6. `tester` (as Tech Lead) synthesizes final verification report

**Deliverable**: `./reports/reviews/REVIEW-{task}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: All tests pass, changed code covered, security validated, no regressions detected
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tester ✓ | tester(exec) ✓ | security-engineer ✓
