# /fix:focus — Focus Issue Resolution

> **MISSION**: Full resolution workflow with **enforced context optimization**.
>
> This variant automatically clears context before implementation—no user prompt required.
> Use when you want guaranteed clean fix implementation without context rot risk.

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

**Skills Resolution**: When delegating, load `SKILLS.md` on-demand for fitness calculation and dynamic discovery (focus variant enables find-skills for superior skill matching).

---

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

| Tier       | When               | Action                       |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent EXISTS | Invoke sub-agent (MANDATORY) |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING       | EMBODY agent file (FALLBACK) |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

## 📁 DELIVERABLE FILES

| Agent      | Output                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| debugger   | `./reports/debugs/DEBUG-{issue}.md`         |
| researcher | `./reports/researchers/RESEARCH-{issue}.md` |

All files in `./reports/` → English only.

---

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time, each phase independent: Phase 1 → then Phase 2 → … in one reply. No batching (load only what each phase needs). **Within each phase:** when doing a part, output it in format so user sees what's happening (announce before doing). Format: rules/PHASES.md § Phase output structure.

## 🎭 Phase 1: DEEP ANALYSIS

| Agent | `debugger`                                                       |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Full root cause analysis                                         |
| Exit  | Root cause identified, impact assessed, failure chain documented |

---

## 🎭 Phase 2: RESEARCH

| Agent | `researcher`                                   |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Research solution patterns                     |
| Exit  | Solutions researched, best approach identified |

---

## 🎭 Phase 3: FIX PLANNING

| Agent | `planner`                         |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Create fix strategy with rollback |
| Exit  | Plan created, rollback included   |

---

---

## ✅ Reloaded:
- User request (original issue verbatim)
- Acceptance criteria (fix verification checkpoints)
- Fix plan with rollback strategy
- Remaining phases workflow
- Implementation rules summary

## ❌ Discarded:
- Debugging hypotheses
- Failed investigation attempts
- Research explorations
- Chat history noise

Mode: Fresh implementation start

Proceeding to Implementation...
```

---

## 🎭 Phase 4: IMPLEMENTATION

| Agent | `tech-lead` → specialists           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Execute fix plan                    |
| Exit  | Fix implemented, changes documented |

---

## 🎭 Phase 5: VALIDATION

| Agent | `tester`                                  |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Comprehensive validation                  |
| Exit  | Issue resolved, tests pass, no regression |

---

## 🎭 Phase 5.5: ROLLBACK VERIFICATION (IF CRITICAL)

| Agent   | `devops-engineer`                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger | Fix affects production or is critical                |
| Goal    | Verify rollback plan                                 |
| Exit    | Rollback documented, tested, recovery time estimated |

## COMPLETION

Present fix report with:

1. ✅ **Fixed** — Issue resolved (Focus Mode)
2. 🧪 **Test** → `/test`
3. 📝 **Docs** → `/docs:core`
