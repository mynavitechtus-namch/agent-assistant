# /fix:team — Golden Triangle Issue Resolution

> **MISSION**: Maximum quality issue resolution through adversarial collaboration.
> Each phase spawns a **Golden Triangle** of 3 agents: Tech Lead (coordinator),
> Executor (implementer), Reviewer (devil's advocate). Output is released ONLY
> upon consensus after debate.

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution
4. **TEAMS.md** — Golden Triangle protocol (MANDATORY)

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

**Skills Resolution**: Load `SKILLS.md` on-demand for fitness calculation and dynamic discovery.

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

> Reference: AGENTS.md (Tiered Execution) + TEAMS.md (Golden Triangle Protocol)

| Tier       | When                          | Action                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent/Agent Tool EXISTS | Orchestrator spawns Tech Lead → Tech Lead spawns Executor + Reviewer      |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING or SYSTEM error  | EMBODY Tech Lead → EMBODY Executor → EMBODY Reviewer → EMBODY Tech Lead  |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

**TIER 2 Golden Triangle Embodiment** (per TEAMS.md):
```
1. EMBODY Tech Lead → decompose task → produce Shared Task List → dispatch
2. EMBODY Executor → implement assigned tasks → post SUBMISSION to Mailbox
3. EMBODY Reviewer → review submissions → post REVIEW to Mailbox
4. IF FAIL → EMBODY Executor again → fix/defend → EMBODY Reviewer → re-check
5. Repeat steps 3–4 max 3 rounds
6. EMBODY Tech Lead → arbitrate if needed → post DECISION → synthesize output
```

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time. Within each phase:

```
1. Spawn Golden Triangle (Tech Lead + Executor + Reviewer)
2. Tech Lead decomposes → publishes Shared Task List
3. Executor implements → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox
4. Reviewer critiques → posts REVIEW to Mailbox
5. Debate loop: fix/defend → re-review (max 3 rounds)
6. Consensus reached → Tech Lead posts DECISION → Phase output released
```

**Consensus Stamp Format** (required to close each phase):
```
✅ CONSENSUS: {TechLead} ✓ | {Executor} ✓ | {Reviewer} ✓
```

Format: rules/PHASES.md § Phase output structure + rules/TEAMS.md § Golden Triangle Phase Output Format.

## 🎭 Phase 1: INVESTIGATION — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `debugger`                           | Decompose: triage bug, define investigation areas, coordinate |
| Executor  | `scouter`                            | Execute: codebase analysis, trace error paths, identify root cause candidates |
| Reviewer  | `researcher` (Devil's Advocate)      | Challenge: question root cause hypotheses, find alternative explanations |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `debugger` triages the issue → decomposes into investigation areas: reproduction steps, error tracing, code path analysis, environmental factors
2. `debugger` posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox for each area → dispatches to `scouter`
3. `scouter` investigates each area deeply → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox with per-area findings:
   - Reproduction results (consistent? intermittent?)
   - Error trace with call stack analysis
   - Code paths traversed and fault candidates
   - Recent changes near fault zone (git blame, recent commits)
   - Environmental variables (config, dependencies, state)
4. `researcher` reviews each SUBMISSION → posts REVIEW to Mailbox:
   - Are the root cause candidates plausible or is correlation confused with causation?
   - Are there alternative explanations not yet explored?
   - Is the evidence chain complete or are there gaps?
   - Could the symptoms mask a deeper systemic issue?
5. If REVIEW = FAIL → `scouter` addresses gaps or defends findings → posts RESUBMISSION/DEFENSE
6. `researcher` re-reviews → max 3 rounds → ESCALATION to `debugger` if unresolved
7. `debugger` synthesizes all approved findings into unified investigation report

**Deliverable**: `./reports/debugs/INVESTIGATION-{issue}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: Bug reproduced, error paths traced, root cause candidates identified, hypotheses challenged, evidence chain documented
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: debugger ✓ | scouter ✓ | researcher ✓

## 🎭 Phase 2: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                                    | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `debugger`                                               | Synthesize investigation → confirm root cause → plan fix approach |
| Executor  | `backend-engineer` / `frontend-engineer` (context-dependent) | Execute: deep-dive into root cause, validate hypothesis with code evidence |
| Reviewer  | `reviewer`                                               | Challenge: verify root cause is correct, check for related issues, regression risk |

**Executor Selection**:
```
IF bug is in server logic, API, database, middleware → backend-engineer
IF bug is in UI rendering, state, events, client logic → frontend-engineer
IF unclear → debugger (Tech Lead) decides based on P1 investigation findings
```

**Prerequisite**: **READ** `./reports/debugs/INVESTIGATION-{issue}.md`

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `debugger` reads investigation report → selects top root cause candidate(s) → decomposes validation tasks:
   - Hypothesis validation with code evidence
   - Impact scope analysis (what else does this affect?)
   - Related issue scan (is this a symptom of a larger pattern?)
2. `debugger` posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox → dispatches to executor
3. Executor deep-dives into each root cause candidate → posts SUBMISSION with:
   - Code evidence proving/disproving each hypothesis
   - Exact lines of code causing the fault
   - Trigger conditions (what input/state causes the fault)
   - Impact scope: all affected components, endpoints, or flows
   - Related issues discovered during analysis
4. `reviewer` reviews each SUBMISSION → posts REVIEW:
   - Is the root cause truly confirmed or just the most obvious suspect?
   - Are there related issues that share the same root cause?
   - What is the regression risk of fixing this area?
   - Could fixing this break something else?
   - Is the impact assessment complete?
5. Debate loop if FAIL → executor defends or deepens analysis → max 3 rounds
6. `debugger` synthesizes confirmed root cause into authoritative debug report

**Deliverable**: `./reports/debugs/DEBUG-{issue}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: Root cause confirmed with code evidence, impact scope documented, regression risk assessed, related issues cataloged
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: debugger ✓ | {executor} ✓ | reviewer ✓

## 🎭 Phase 3: FIX PLANNING — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `planner`                            | Decompose: plan fix steps, define acceptance criteria, rollback strategy |
| Executor  | `researcher`                         | Execute: research fix approaches, evaluate trade-offs, draft plan sections |
| Reviewer  | `tech-lead` (feasibility critic)     | Challenge: question approach, verify no side effects, check regression risk |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** `./reports/debugs/DEBUG-{issue}.md`

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `planner` reads debug report → decomposes fix planning into sections:
   - Fix approach evaluation (multiple strategies)
   - Implementation task breakdown
   - Rollback strategy
   - Acceptance criteria derived from root cause
   - Risk matrix
2. `planner` posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox → dispatches to `researcher`
3. `researcher` researches and drafts each plan section → posts SUBMISSION per section:
   - Fix approaches compared (minimal patch vs. refactor vs. redesign)
   - Trade-off analysis: risk, effort, long-term maintainability
   - Implementation tasks with ordering and dependencies
   - Rollback steps with verification criteria
   - Acceptance criteria: how to prove the bug is fixed
4. `tech-lead` reviews each plan section → posts REVIEW:
   - Is the fix approach proportional to the bug severity?
   - Are there side effects not accounted for?
   - Is the rollback strategy actually viable under failure?
   - Are estimates realistic?
   - Does the fix address root cause or just symptoms?
   - Will the fix introduce new technical debt?
5. Debate loop if FAIL → `researcher` adjusts or defends → max 3 rounds
6. `planner` synthesizes all approved sections into final fix plan

**Deliverable**: `./reports/plans/PLAN-{issue}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: Fix approach selected, implementation steps defined, rollback strategy verified, acceptance criteria set, risks mitigated
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: planner ✓ | researcher ✓ | tech-lead ✓

### STRICT PLAN ADHERENCE (ENFORCED BY REVIEWER)

```
1. READ PLAN FIRST — every task MUST trace to a plan step
2. IF step seems wrong → STOP → Executor posts ESCALATION to Mailbox
   → Tech Lead evaluates → Request Re-Planning or Override
3. NO unauthorized deviations — Reviewer explicitly checks for this:
   "Does this SUBMISSION match the plan step? Any additions not in plan?"
4. Deviations found by Reviewer → automatic FAIL with:
   Severity: CRITICAL | Action: "Remove unauthorized code or get plan amended"
```

**Exit Criteria**: All fix tasks implemented, all reviews passed, no unauthorized deviations, root cause addressed, integration verified
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tech-lead ✓ | {executor} ✓ | reviewer ✓

## 🎭 Phase 5: TESTING & VERIFICATION — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tester`                             | Decompose: test strategy for fix verification + regression testing |
| Executor  | `tester` (self-implements tests)     | Execute: write tests proving fix, run regression suite, generate coverage |
| Reviewer  | `security-engineer`                  | Challenge: edge cases, security implications, verify no regressions introduced |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** `PLAN-{issue}.md` + `DEBUG-{issue}.md` + implementation changes

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `tester` (as Tech Lead) reads plan + debug report + code changes → decomposes into test strategy:
   - Fix verification tests (prove the bug is fixed)
   - Regression tests (prove nothing else broke)
   - Edge case tests (boundary conditions near the fault)
   - Security test cases (if fix touches auth, input, or data flow)
   - Performance baseline assertions (if fix touches hot paths)
2. `tester` (as Tech Lead) posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox with test plan
3. `tester` (as Executor) writes and runs all tests → posts SUBMISSION per test category:
   - Tests written (file list)
   - Tests passed / failed
   - Coverage percentage for changed files
   - Root cause verification results
4. `security-engineer` reviews test submissions → posts REVIEW:
   - Does the fix verification test actually prove the root cause is resolved?
   - Are regression tests covering adjacent functionality?
   - Edge cases: what inputs/states near the fault boundary are untested?
   - Security: if the fix area handles user input or auth, are security tests present?
   - Could the fix be bypassed or cause a new vulnerability?
5. Debate loop if FAIL → fix gaps or defend → max 3 rounds
6. `tester` (as Tech Lead) synthesizes final QA report

**ROOT CAUSE VERIFICATION** (MANDATORY):
```
FOR EACH symptom in DEBUG-{issue}.md:
  → tester: Write test reproducing original bug (must FAIL without fix, PASS with fix)
  → security-engineer: Confirm test truly validates root cause fix (not a trivial pass)
  → Document: "Symptom X → Test: {test name} → Root Cause Y → Verified: {pass/fail}"
```

**REGRESSION VERIFICATION** (MANDATORY):
```
FOR EACH affected component in DEBUG-{issue}.md:
  → tester: Write regression test for adjacent functionality
  → security-engineer: Verify no new attack surface introduced
  → Document: "Component X → Regression Test: {test name} → Status: {pass/fail}"
```

**Deliverable**: `./reports/qa/QA-{issue}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: Fix verified against root cause, regression tests pass, security validated, edge cases covered, no new vulnerabilities
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tester ✓ | tester(exec) ✓ | security-engineer ✓
