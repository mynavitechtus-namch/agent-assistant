## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS EXECUTION)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):
1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing  
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution  
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution  

**⛔ Do not run any workflow phase until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files. Then run this file's ROUTING LOGIC, LOAD the chosen variant workflow, and execute it.

---

## ROUTING LOGIC

```
IF scope is limited (unit tests, quick check):
  → Route to /test:fast

IF scope is comprehensive (full suite, E2E):
  → Route to /test:hard

IF scope is comprehensive AND clean execution focus is critical:
  → Route to /test:focus

IF scope is comprehensive AND maximum quality with team collaboration needed:
  → Route to /test:team

IF unsure:
  → Default to /test:fast
```
