# /cook — Feature Implementation Router

> **ROUTER DIRECTIVE**: Analyze feature complexity and route to appropriate implementation workflow.

<feature>$ARGUMENTS</feature>

---

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS EXECUTION)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md
2. ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md
3. EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

**⛔ Do not run any workflow phase until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files. Then run this file's ROUTING LOGIC, LOAD the chosen variant workflow, and execute it.

---

## ROUTING LOGIC

```
IF feature is simple (clear spec, low complexity):
  → Route to /cook:fast

IF feature is complex (multi-component, research needed):
  → Route to /cook:hard

IF feature is complex AND context optimization is critical:
  → Route to /cook:focus

IF unsure:
  → Default to /cook:fast
```

## AVAILABLE ROUTES

| Route         | When to Use                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/cook:fast`  | Quick features, clear specifications                    |
| `/cook:hard`  | Complex features, full workflow                         |
| `/cook:focus` | Complex features with **enforced context optimization** |

## PRESENT OPTIONS

```markdown
## 🍳 Feature Mode Selection

**Feature**: [parsed feature]

**Choose workflow:**

1. ⚡ **Fast** → `/cook:fast` — Quick implementation
2. ⚡⚡⚡ **Hard** → `/cook:hard` — Full feature development
3. 🎯 **Focus** → `/cook:focus` — Full development with **automatic context clearing** (prevents hallucination)

⏳ Awaiting selection...
