# /design — Design Router

> **ROUTER DIRECTIVE**: Analyze design need and route to appropriate workflow.

<request>$ARGUMENTS</request>

---

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS EXECUTION)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution

**⛔ Do not run any workflow phase until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files. Then run this file's ROUTING LOGIC, LOAD the chosen variant workflow, and execute it.

---

## ROUTING LOGIC

```
IF design is simple (component, quick mockup):
  → Route to /design:fast

IF design is complex (full feature, system):
  → Route to /design:hard

IF design is complex AND clean implementation handoff is critical:
  → Route to /design:focus

IF design is complex AND maximum quality with team collaboration needed:
  → Route to /design:team

IF unsure:
  → Default to /design:fast
```
