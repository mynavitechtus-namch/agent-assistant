# /plan — Planning Router

> **ROUTER DIRECTIVE**: Analyze planning need and route to appropriate workflow.

<task>$ARGUMENTS</task>

---

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS EXECUTION)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md
2. ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md
3. EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

**⛔ Do not run any workflow phase until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files. Then run this file's ROUTING LOGIC, LOAD the chosen variant (e.g. plan/hard.md), and execute it.

---

## ROUTING LOGIC

```
IF task is clear (known approach, codebase-only):
  → Route to /plan:fast

IF task is complex (research needed, architectural):
  → Route to /plan:hard

IF task is complex AND clean implementation handoff is critical:
  → Route to /plan:focus

IF unsure:
  → Default to /plan:fast
```
