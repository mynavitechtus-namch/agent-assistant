<task>$ARGUMENTS</task>

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md
2. ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md
3. EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

---

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

| Tier       | When               | Action                       |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent EXISTS | Invoke sub-agent (MANDATORY) |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING       | EMBODY agent file (FALLBACK) |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

---

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time, each phase independent: Phase 1 → then Phase 2 → … in one reply. No batching (load only what each phase needs). **Within each phase:** when doing a part, output it in format so user sees what's happening (announce before doing). Format: rules/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md § Phase output structure.

## 🎭 Phase 1: INFORMATION GATHERING

| Agent | `reporter`                               |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Scan current state and recent activities |
| Exit  | Progress summarized, key sources scanned |

---

## 🎭 Phase 2: REPORT GENERATION

| Agent | `reporter`                                                                 |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Infer intent; if **create report** → generate concise status report        |
| Exit  | Report with Summary, Key Changes, Next Steps — or recommend `/report:hard`/`/report:focus` if user intent is update/template |
