# /report:team — Golden Triangle Report Generation

> **MISSION**: Maximum quality reporting through adversarial collaboration.
> Each phase spawns a **Golden Triangle** of 3 agents: Tech Lead (coordinator),
> Executor (implementer), Reviewer (devil's advocate). Output is released ONLY
> upon consensus after debate.

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):

1. CORE.md — Identity, Laws, Routing
2. PHASES.md — Phase Execution
3. AGENTS.md — Tiered Execution
4. **TEAMS.md** — Golden Triangle protocol (MANDATORY)

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

**Skills Resolution**: Load `SKILLS.md` on-demand for fitness calculation and dynamic discovery.

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

> Reference: AGENTS.md (Tiered Execution) + TEAMS.md (Golden Triangle Protocol)

| Tier       | When                          | Action                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent/Agent Tool EXISTS | Orchestrator spawns Tech Lead → Tech Lead spawns Executor + Reviewer      |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING or SYSTEM error  | EMBODY Tech Lead → EMBODY Executor → EMBODY Reviewer → EMBODY Tech Lead  |

**❌ Anti-Lazy**: Never use TIER 2 when TIER 1 tool available.

**TIER 2 Golden Triangle Embodiment** (per TEAMS.md):
```
1. EMBODY Tech Lead → decompose task → produce Shared Task List → dispatch
2. EMBODY Executor → execute assigned tasks → post SUBMISSION to Mailbox
3. EMBODY Reviewer → review submissions → post REVIEW to Mailbox
4. IF FAIL → EMBODY Executor again → fix/defend → EMBODY Reviewer → re-check
5. Repeat steps 3–4 max 3 rounds
6. EMBODY Tech Lead → arbitrate if needed → post DECISION → synthesize output
```

---

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time. Within each phase:

```
1. Spawn Golden Triangle (Tech Lead + Executor + Reviewer)
2. Tech Lead decomposes → publishes Shared Task List
3. Executor implements → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox
4. Reviewer critiques → posts REVIEW to Mailbox
5. Debate loop: fix/defend → re-review (max 3 rounds)
6. Consensus reached → Tech Lead posts DECISION → Phase output released
```

**Consensus Stamp Format** (required to close each phase):
```
✅ CONSENSUS: {TechLead} ✓ | {Executor} ✓ | {Reviewer} ✓
```

Format: rules/PHASES.md § Phase output structure + rules/TEAMS.md § Golden Triangle Phase Output Format.

## 🎭 Phase 1: DATA COLLECTION & ANALYSIS — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                    | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `reporter`                               | Decompose: report scope, data sources, analysis dimensions |
| Executor  | `scouter` + `researcher`                 | Execute: collect data from codebase, analyze metrics, gather facts |
| Reviewer  | `business-analyst` (Devil's Advocate)    | Challenge: data complete? Metrics meaningful? Missing context? Bias in collection? |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `reporter` decomposes data collection into areas: report scope, target audience, data sources, analysis dimensions, success metrics
2. `reporter` posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox for each area → dispatches to `scouter` + `researcher`
3. `scouter` deep-scans codebase for relevant evidence → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox with:
   - File structure and architecture relevant to topic
   - Code metrics, complexity scores, dependency maps
   - Recent changes, commit history patterns, contributor activity
   - Raw data points with exact file paths and line references
4. `researcher` analyzes patterns and gathers contextual facts → posts SUBMISSION with:
   - Industry benchmarks and best practices for comparison
   - Historical trends and prior art
   - Cross-reference analysis between data sources
   - Quantified metrics with methodology notes
5. `business-analyst` reviews EACH SUBMISSION → posts REVIEW to Mailbox:
   - Is the data collection complete or are there blind spots?
   - Are the metrics actually meaningful for the report's audience?
   - Is there selection bias in what was collected vs. what was ignored?
   - Are data sources reliable? Any contradictions between sources?
   - What context is missing that stakeholders would expect?
6. If REVIEW = FAIL → `scouter`/`researcher` addresses gaps or defends findings → posts RESUBMISSION/DEFENSE
7. `business-analyst` re-reviews → max 3 rounds → ESCALATION to `reporter` if unresolved
8. `reporter` synthesizes all approved findings into unified data package

**Deliverable**: `./reports/scouts/SCOUT-{topic}.md` + `./reports/researchers/RESEARCH-{topic}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: All data sources tapped, metrics collected, patterns identified, gaps acknowledged, analysis dimensions defined
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: reporter ✓ | scouter/researcher ✓ | business-analyst ✓

## 🎭 Phase 2: REPORT DRAFTING — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE (CRITICAL)

> **THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL PHASE.** Every step is detailed. No shortcuts.

| Role      | Agent                                    | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `reporter`                               | Coordinate: report structure, key findings, recommendations |
| Executor  | `reporter` (self-implements)             | Execute: write REPORT-{topic}.md with findings, analysis, recommendations |
| Reviewer  | `tech-lead` + `reviewer` lens            | Challenge: conclusions supported by data? Recommendations actionable? Missing risks? |

**Prerequisite**: **READ** SCOUT + RESEARCH outputs from Phase 1.

### REPORT STRUCTURE (produced by `reporter`)

```markdown
# Report: {topic}
**Date**: {date} | **Type**: {status|analysis|audit|assessment}
**Author**: report:team (Golden Triangle) | **Audience**: {target}

## Executive Summary
- Overall assessment (1-2 paragraphs)
- Critical findings (top 3-5, bullet points)
- Key recommendations (prioritized)
- Risk level: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL}

## Scope & Methodology
- What was analyzed and why
- Data sources consulted
- Analysis methods applied
- Known limitations and caveats

## Findings
### Finding 1: {title}
- **Evidence**: {code refs, metrics, raw data}
- **Analysis**: {interpretation of evidence}
- **Impact**: {business/technical impact assessment}
- **Confidence**: {HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW} — {justification}

### Finding 2: {title}
{same structure...}

## Analysis
- Cross-cutting patterns across findings
- Root cause analysis (where applicable)
- Trend identification and projections
- Comparison against benchmarks/standards

## Recommendations
| # | Recommendation | Priority | Effort | Impact | Owner |
|---|---------------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | {specific action} | P0 | {S/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {team} |
| 2 | {specific action} | P1 | {S/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {team} |

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| {risk if no action} | H/M/L | H/M/L | {recommended action} |

## Appendix
- Raw data tables
- Additional code references
- Methodology details
- Glossary (if audience needs it)
```

### STRICT EVIDENCE ADHERENCE (ENFORCED BY REVIEWER)

```
1. READ Phase 1 DATA FIRST — every claim MUST trace to collected evidence
2. IF data insufficient → STOP → Reporter posts ESCALATION to Mailbox
   → Request additional data collection or acknowledge limitation
3. NO unsupported claims — Reviewer explicitly checks for this:
   "Does this claim have evidence in Phase 1 deliverables? Source cited?"
4. Unsupported claims found by Reviewer → automatic FAIL with:
   Severity: CRITICAL | Action: "Add evidence or remove claim"
```

**Deliverable**: `./reports/general/REPORT-{topic}-{date}.md`
**Exit Criteria**: All sections drafted, every claim evidence-backed, recommendations actionable, report coherent
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: reporter ✓ | reporter(exec) ✓ | reviewer ✓

## 🎭 Phase 3: REVIEW & DELIVERY — 🔺 GOLDEN TRIANGLE

| Role      | Agent                                    | Mission                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech Lead | `tech-lead`                              | Final review, quality gate, release authorization          |
| Executor  | `docs-manager`                           | Execute: format, polish, executive summary refinement      |
| Reviewer  | `business-analyst` (Devil's Advocate)    | Challenge: stakeholder-ready? Clear for audience? Actionable next steps? |

**Triangle Loop**:
1. `tech-lead` reads draft REPORT-{topic}-{date}.md → decomposes final review into tasks:
   - Executive summary quality check
   - Formatting and presentation polish
   - Audience appropriateness verification
   - Actionability and completeness audit
2. `tech-lead` posts TASK_ASSIGNMENT to Mailbox → dispatches to `docs-manager`
3. `docs-manager` polishes the report → posts SUBMISSION to Mailbox with:
   - Formatting improvements applied (headings, tables, visual hierarchy)
   - Executive summary refined for clarity and impact
   - Language adjusted for target audience
   - Table of contents / navigation aids added
   - Consistent terminology and style throughout
4. `business-analyst` reviews polished report → posts REVIEW:
   - Would a stakeholder understand this without additional context?
   - Are next steps clear enough that someone can act on them Monday morning?
   - Is the executive summary a standalone artifact for busy executives?
   - Are priorities and severity levels calibrated correctly?
   - Does the report tell a coherent story from findings to recommendations?
5. If REVIEW = FAIL → `docs-manager` revises or defends → posts RESUBMISSION/DEFENSE
6. `business-analyst` re-reviews → max 3 rounds → ESCALATION to `tech-lead` if unresolved
7. `tech-lead` performs final quality gate:
   - All Phase 2 consensus items preserved
   - No content distortion from formatting changes
   - Report ready for distribution

**DELIVERY CHECKLIST** (executed by `tech-lead`):
```
- [ ] Executive summary is standalone and actionable
- [ ] All claims supported by evidence (preserved from Phase 2)
- [ ] Recommendations prioritized with clear ownership
- [ ] Language appropriate for target audience
- [ ] Formatting professional and consistent
- [ ] No contradictions between sections
- [ ] Risk assessment complete with mitigations
- [ ] Appendix contains supporting raw data
```

**Deliverable**: `./reports/general/REPORT-{topic}-{date}.md` (final polished version)
**Exit Criteria**: Report stakeholder-ready, professionally formatted, actionable recommendations, quality gate passed
**Consensus**: ✅ CONSENSUS: tech-lead ✓ | docs-manager ✓ | business-analyst ✓
