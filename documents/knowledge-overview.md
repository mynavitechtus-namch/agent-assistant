## 2. Purpose and Mission

Agent Assistant transforms a single AI coding assistant into a **coordinated team of 21 specialist agents** with structured workflows, quality gates, and 310+ domain skills.

### Core Value Proposition

```
Without Agent Assistant:
  User → Single AI → Generic response → Manual verification

With Agent Assistant:
  User → Command → Orchestrator → Specialist Agents → Skills → Quality Gates → Verified Output
```

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Orchestrator Pattern

The orchestrator is the central brain that coordinates all work:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ORCHESTRATOR — THE CENTRAL BRAIN                                              ║
║                                                                               ║
║ ✅ YOU DO: Delegate, coordinate, verify, synthesize                          ║
║ ❌ YOU NEVER: Write code, debug, test, design, or implement directly         ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### 5.2 Tiered Execution

| Tier   | Name                 | When Used           | Context                 |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| TIER 1 | Sub-agent Delegation | When tool available | ISOLATED (fresh memory) |
| TIER 2 | Agent Embodiment     | Fallback only       | SHARED (same memory)    |

**Rule**: TIER 1 is MANDATORY when available. TIER 2 is FALLBACK only.

### 5.3 Matrix Skill Discovery

Instead of hardcoding skills in agents, the system uses profile-based skill injection:

```yaml
# Agent declares profile (not skill list)
profile: "backend:execution"

# System resolves skills from Matrix
Agent declares profile → Matrix resolves domains → Skills injected at runtime
```

### 5.4 Command Routing

Commands follow a router pattern with variants:

```
/command:variant → commands/{command}/{variant}.md

Examples:
  /cook:fast → commands/cook/fast.md (quick execution)
  /cook:hard → commands/cook/hard.md (full workflow)
```

### 5.5 Phase-Based Workflows

All workflows execute as sequential phases:

```
Pre-flight → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → ... → Phase N → Completion
     ↓           ↓          ↓              ↓           ↓
Load rules   Delegate   Delegate      Delegate    Summary
            + Verify   + Verify      + Verify
```

## 6. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** installed

### Installation Options

#### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hainamchung/agent-assistant.git
cd agent-assistant
node cli/install.js install --all
```

### First Commands

After installation, generate project documentation:

```bash
/docs:core       # Generate 5 core docs (overview, architecture, domain, source-base, standards)
/docs:business   # Generate 4 business docs (PRD, features, workflows, glossary)
```

Then try development commands:

```bash
/cook:fast "add dark mode toggle"           # Simple feature
/cook:hard "implement OAuth 2.0 authentication"  # Complex feature
/review "audit authentication module"       # Code review
/plan "build notification system"           # Implementation plan
