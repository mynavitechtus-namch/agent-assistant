# HSOL (Hybrid Skill Orchestration Layer) — Production Readiness Assessment

> **Purpose**: One-time evaluation of HSOL design and docs for production readiness and agent intelligence.
> **Scope**: SKILL.md, _index.yaml, _dynamic.yaml, find-skills SKILL, Blueprint.
> **Project version**: 1.1.0

## Executive Summary

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Completeness** | Strong | Resolution algorithm, decision gate, blocking/async, variant/fitness, trust, conflict, edge cases are defined. |
| **Consistency** | Strong | Thresholds (0.75, 0.8), variant (fast/hard/focus), and flow align across Discovery, Orchestration, _index.yaml, Blueprint. |
| **Production readiness** | Good | Clear rules for tool scope, install commands, fallbacks; a few operational gaps (see below). |
| **Agent intelligence** | Strong | Matrix-first + dynamic enhancement, blocking when matrix insufficient so current task uses new skill; async when matrix adequate. |

**Verdict**: HSOL is **sufficient for production** as a **specification and rule set** for orchestrators and agents. Implementers (or AI following the rules) have enough to resolve skills, decide when to discover, and handle install/recommend. Suggested updates below are small clarifications and one extra edge case.

## Strengths

1. **Clear separation of concerns**
   - SKILL-DISCOVERY: *what* (10-step flow, resolution algorithm, when discovery runs).
   - SKILL-ORCHESTRATION: *how to decide* (6-step flow, decision gate, trust, conflict, config).
   - Single source of truth for thresholds in `_index.yaml`.

2. **Variant + fitness logic**
   - Fast → no discovery (keeps fast path low-latency).
   - Hard/Focus + fitness ≥ 0.8 → skip discovery.
   - Hard/Focus + 0.75 ≤ fitness < 0.8 → async (recommend for next time).
   - Hard/Focus + fitness < 0.75 → blocking (current task uses new skill). Aligns with “skill for current work” goal.

3. **Tool-scoped behavior**
   - All install/verify actions are for the **current tool only**; `-g -y` and no cross-tool install unless user asks. Reduces confusion and errors.

4. **Trust and safety**
   - Low-trust + task-critical → ask user confirm before install.
   - Trust progression and auto-promotion criteria are defined.
   - Conflict resolution (ID collision, domain overlap) is specified.

5. **Edge cases**
   - Network timeout → proceed with matrix, surface message.
   - No skills found → capability gap, offer general help + `npx skills init`.
   - Installation failure → rollback, retry command, offer matrix-only.

6. **Discoverability**
   - BOOTSTRAP and QUICK-REFERENCE point to HSOL; rules reference Blueprint and each other.

## Gaps and Improvements

### 1. Principle wording (minor)

**Issue**: SKILL-ORCHESTRATION says “Dynamic discovery never blocks execution.” We also have a **blocking** path when fitness < 0.75.

**Fix**: Clarify that discovery **does** block only when matrix is insufficient (< 0.75) so the current task can use the new skill; otherwise it does not block. (Doc update below.)

### 2. find-skills missing or unavailable (operational)

**Issue**: If find-skills is not installed, or `npx skills find` fails (e.g. network, CLI not available), the blocking path cannot run. Doc does not state the fallback.

**Fix**: Add edge case: “If find-skills is not available or discovery cannot run, proceed with matrix skills only and optionally surface: ‘Dynamic skill discovery is unavailable. Using built-in skills.’” (Doc update below.)

### 3. BOOTSTRAP reference table (discoverability)

**Issue**: BOOTSTRAP lists “Skill resolution (HSOL) → SKILL.md” but not SKILL.md. Implementers need both (algorithm + decision logic).

**Fix**: Add one row for “Matrix resolution algorithm (HSOL)” → SKILL.md, or a note that HSOL = SKILL-ORCHESTRATION + SKILL-DISCOVERY. (Doc update below.)

### 4. _dynamic.yaml writer (optional clarity)

**Issue**: _dynamic.yaml says “HSOL validates and registers skill here” but does not say *who* writes it (e.g. skills CLI on `npx skills add`, or a post-install hook). For code implementations, this matters.

**Suggestion**: In _dynamic.yaml or Blueprint, add one line: “Updated when user runs `npx skills add <skill> -g -y` (skills CLI or install script appends/updates this file).” No change required if the repo is doc-only and the “resolver” is the human/orchestrator.

### 5. Default variant (optional)

**Issue**: When user says `/cook` without `:fast` or `:hard`, the router picks a default. Discovery runs only for hard/focus. If the default is “hard”, discovery applies; if “fast”, it does not. Not ambiguous but could be explicit.

**Suggestion**: In SKILL-DISCOVERY or SKILL-ORCHESTRATION, one line: “When command has no variant, use the router’s default (e.g. hard for full workflows); discovery eligibility follows that variant.” Optional.

### 6. Security (optional)

**Issue**: Doc does not mention malicious or low-quality skill content. We already have: low-trust → confirm; recommend trusted sources (e.g. vercel-labs/agent-skills).

**Suggestion**: Short note: “Skills execute in agent context. For production, prefer skills from trusted sources; user confirmation is required for low-trust, task-critical installs.” Optional.

## What Is Already Production-Ready

- **Decision logic**: Variant + fitness gates are deterministic and implementable.
- **Install flow**: Commands, scope (current tool), and confirm rules are clear.
- **Fallbacks**: Timeout, no skills, install failure are handled.
- **Config**: _index.yaml has discovery on/off, thresholds, variants, promotion; per-agent overrides exist.
- **Cross-doc alignment**: Thresholds (0.75, 0.8), variant list (hard, focus), and flow (blocking vs async) match across docs and config.

---

## Recommended Doc Updates (Applied)

1. **SKILL.md**
   - Clarify principle “non_blocking_discovery” so blocking path (fitness < 0.75) is explicit.
   - Add edge case: “find-skills not installed or discovery unavailable → proceed with matrix only, optional message.”

2. **BOOTSTRAP.md**
   - Add SKILL.md to the reference table (or note “HSOL = SKILL-DISCOVERY + SKILL-ORCHESTRATION”) so both files are loaded when implementing HSOL.

3. **Optional (not applied)**
   - _dynamic.yaml: one line on who updates it (CLI/post-install).
   - Default variant sentence in Discovery or Orchestration.
   - One-sentence security note in Orchestration.

## Conclusion

HSOL is **ready for production use** as a specification: logic is complete, consistent, and sufficient for agents and orchestrators to resolve skills intelligently (matrix-first, dynamic when needed, blocking when matrix is insufficient). The suggested updates are small clarifications and one extra fallback; they improve robustness and discoverability without changing behavior.
