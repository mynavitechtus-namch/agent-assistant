## 1. Overview

This glossary defines the key terms, concepts, and acronyms used throughout Agent Assistant. Terms are organized alphabetically within categories for easy reference.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### Agent

A **specialist persona** with defined expertise, thinking protocol, and constraints. Each agent has a specific role (e.g., backend development, testing, security) and operates within defined boundaries.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ID | Unique identifier (e.g., `backend-engineer`) |
| Profile | Domain:category classification (e.g., `backend:execution`) |
| Role | Human-readable job title |
| Skills | Domain knowledge injected via Matrix |

**Example**: The `tester` agent specializes in test strategy, automation, and coverage analysis.

---

### Command

A **slash-prefixed workflow trigger** that initiates a structured development process. Commands route to workflows that orchestrate multiple agents.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Basic | `/cook` |
| With variant | `/cook:hard` |
| With argument | `/cook:hard "implement OAuth"` |

**Available Commands**: `/cook`, `/fix`, `/plan`, `/test`, `/review`, `/debug`, `/design`, `/docs`, `/report`, `/deploy`, `/ask`, `/auto`, `/brainstorm`, `/code`

---

### Deliverable

A **concrete output** produced by an agent during workflow execution. Deliverables include code files, documentation, plans, reports, and test files.

| Type | Example Location |
|------|------------------|
| Plan | `./reports/{topic}/plans/PLAN-auth.md` |
| Scout Report | `./reports/{topic}/scouts/SCOUT-dashboard.md` |
| Documentation | `./documents/knowledge-overview.md` |
| Code | Implementation in codebase |

---

### Matrix Skill Discovery (HSOL)

A **Hybrid Skill Orchestration Layer (HSOL)** that combines static matrix-skills with dynamic community skills. Skills are resolved by agent profile and request context; dynamic discovery runs only for `hard`/`focus` variants when matrix fitness &lt; 0.8 (blocking when &lt; 0.75 so the current task uses the new skill; async when 0.75–0.8 for recommendations only). See `rules/SKILL.md`.

**Resolution Flow**:
```
Agent Profile → _index.yaml → Domain Files + _dynamic.yaml → Fitness → Inject; optionally discover (find-skills) by variant
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth (matrix + dynamic manifest)
- Variant-aware: fast skips discovery; hard/focus use blocking/async by fitness
- Current task can use newly installed skill when matrix insufficient (&lt; 0.75)

---

### Orchestrator

The **central coordination layer** that manages workflow execution. The Orchestrator routes commands, delegates to agents, verifies quality gates, and synthesizes outputs.

**Key Principle**: Orchestrators COORDINATE but never IMPLEMENT directly.

| Does | Does NOT |
|------|----------|
| Route commands | Write code |
| Delegate to agents | Debug issues |
| Verify exit criteria | Run tests directly |
| Synthesize outputs | Design systems |

---

### Phase

A **discrete step** within a workflow with defined entry requirements, agent delegation, actions, and exit criteria. Phases execute sequentially.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Agent | Specialist assigned to phase |
| Goal | Objective of the phase |
| Actions | Steps to complete |
| Exit Criteria | Conditions to proceed |
| Deliverable | Output produced |

---

### Profile

A **domain:category classification** that determines which skills an agent receives from the Matrix.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Pattern | `{domain}:{category}` |
| Backend | `backend:execution` |
| QA | `quality:validation` |
| Architecture | `architecture:orchestration` |

---

### Quality Gate

An **automated verification checkpoint** that must pass before workflow progression. Agent Assistant implements 5 gates.

| Gate | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Compile | Code builds successfully |
| Lint | Code style compliance |
| Test | Tests pass, coverage met |
| Security | No vulnerabilities |
| Review | Code review approved |

---

### Skill

A **domain-specific knowledge module** loaded on-demand to enhance agent capabilities. Skills provide guidelines, patterns, and best practices.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ID | Unique identifier (e.g., `api-patterns`) |
| Domain | Category (e.g., `backend`) |
| Priority | 1-10 (10 = critical) |
| Category | core, expert, specialized, utility |

---

### Variant

A **workflow intensity level** that determines the number of agents, phases, and quality gates applied.

| Variant | Agents | Phases | Gates | Use Case |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| `:fast` | 2-3 | 3-4 | Minimal | Simple, low-risk |
| `:hard` | 5-8 | 6-8 | All 5 | Complex, production |

---

### Workflow

A **structured sequence of phases** that accomplishes a development goal. Workflows are defined in command files and executed by the Orchestrator.

**Workflow Structure**:
```
Pre-flight → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → ... → Phase N → Completion
```

---

## 3. Orchestration Terms

### Context Isolation

The principle that **agent sessions operate independently** without sharing memory or polluting each other's context.

| Tier | Context Model |
|------|---------------|
| TIER 1 (Sub-agent) | ISOLATED (fresh memory) |
| TIER 2 (Embody) | SHARED (same memory) |

---

### Deep Embodiment

When the Orchestrator **fully transforms into an agent**, adopting its thinking protocol, constraints, and output format exactly.

**Embodiment Checklist**:
- [ ] Core directive extracted
- [ ] Thinking protocol adopted
- [ ] Constraints bound
- [ ] Output format memorized

---

### Exit Criteria

**Conditions that must be satisfied** before a phase can transition to the next. Exit criteria ensure quality and completeness.

**Example**:
```markdown
- [ ] Project structure mapped
- [ ] Tech stack identified
- [ ] Key files located
```

---

### Handoff

The **transfer of work** from one agent to another during workflow execution. Handoffs include essential context but exclude internal reasoning.

**Handoff Includes**:
- Original requirements
- Prior decisions
- Constraints
- Deliverables

**Handoff Excludes**:
- Internal reasoning chains
- Failed attempts
- Rejected alternatives

---

### Orchestration Laws

The **10 inviolable rules** that govern all orchestration behavior. Violations must be detected and corrected.

| Law | Name |
|-----|------|
| 1 | Absolute Decentralization |
| 2 | Requirement Integrity |
| 3 | Workflow Sovereignty |
| 4 | Deep Agent Embodiment |
| 5 | Context Isolation |
| 6 | Language Matching |
| 7 | Recursive Delegation |
| 8 | Stateful Handoff |
| 9 | Constraint Propagation |
| 10 | Tiered Execution |

---

### TIER 1 Execution (Sub-agent)

**Native tool invocation** where an agent runs in an isolated context with fresh memory. TIER 1 is MANDATORY when available.

**Characteristics**:
- Isolated context
- Fresh memory
- Preferred for quality
- Requires tool support

---

### TIER 2 Execution (Embody)

**Fallback pattern** where the Orchestrator reads an agent file and transforms to become that agent within shared context.

**When Used**:
- TIER 1 tool unavailable
- System error in TIER 1
- Never for preference/efficiency

---

### Tiered Execution

The **protocol for choosing** between TIER 1 (sub-agent) and TIER 2 (embody) execution modes.

**Decision Flow**:
1. Check if sub-agent tool exists
2. If yes → MUST use TIER 1
3. If no or error → MAY use TIER 2

---

## 4. Workflow Terms

### Blocking Phase

A phase that **cannot proceed** without deliverables from prior phases. Prior deliverables become immutable constraints.

**Example**: Implementation phase blocked until Plan exists.

---

### Drift Detection

**Identifying when implementation deviates** from the approved plan. Drift requires re-planning before continuing.

**Detected By**: `tech-lead` agent during implementation oversight.

---

### Just-In-Time Loading

The principle of **loading resources only when needed** by the current phase, rather than loading everything upfront.

**Benefits**:
- Efficient context usage
- Faster initial response
- Reduced memory pressure

---

### Pre-flight

**Mandatory setup steps** before workflow execution, including loading rule files and checking prerequisites.

**Pre-flight Actions**:
1. Load ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md
2. Load ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md
3. Load EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

---

### Router

A **command file** that analyzes the request and selects the appropriate variant based on complexity.

**Routing Example**:
```
/cook → cook.md (router) → Analyzes request → cook/hard.md (selected)
```

---
