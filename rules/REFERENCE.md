## DELIVERABLE PATHS

### Single File (≤ 150 lines, < 4 sections)

```yaml
brainstormer:         ./reports/{topic}/brainstorms/BRAINSTORM-{feature}.md
researcher:           ./reports/{topic}/researchers/RESEARCH-{feature}.md
scouter:              ./reports/{topic}/scouts/SCOUT-{feature}.md
designer:             ./reports/{topic}/designs/DESIGN-{feature}.md
planner:              ./reports/{topic}/plans/PLAN-{feature}.md
reporter:             ./reports/{topic}/general/REPORT-{type}-{date}.md
debugger:             ./reports/{topic}/debugs/DEBUG-{issue}.md

business-analyst:     ./reports/{topic}/requirements/REQ-{feature}.md
performance-engineer: ./reports/{topic}/performance/PERF-{component}.md
```

### Chunked Folder (> 150 lines OR ≥ 4 sections)

```yaml
brainstormer:         ./reports/{topic}/brainstorms/{feature}/00-index.md + sections
researcher:           ./reports/{topic}/researchers/{feature}/00-index.md + sections
scouter:              ./reports/{topic}/scouts/{feature}/00-index.md + sections
designer:             ./reports/{topic}/designs/{feature}/00-index.md + sections
planner:              ./reports/{topic}/plans/{feature}/00-index.md + sections
reporter:             ./reports/{topic}/general/{type}-{date}/00-index.md + sections
debugger:             ./reports/{topic}/debugs/{issue}/00-index.md + sections
tester:               ./reports/{topic}/tests/{feature}/00-index.md + sections
business-analyst:     ./reports/{topic}/requirements/{feature}/00-index.md + sections
performance-engineer: ./reports/{topic}/performance/{component}/00-index.md + sections
```

> **Rule**: Create `00-index.md` FIRST, then section files SEQUENTIALLY. See `PHASES.md > DELIVERABLE SIZE MANAGEMENT`.

## DOCUMENTATION PATHS (from /docs:core)

```yaml
overview:     ./documents/knowledge-overview.md
architecture: ./documents/knowledge-architecture.md
domain:       ./documents/knowledge-domain.md
source-base:  ./documents/knowledge-source-base.md
standards:    ./documents/knowledge-standards.md
```

## RULES FILES

| File | Purpose | Load When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `CORE.md` | Entry point, identity, routing | **Always** |
| `PHASES.md` | Phase execution, output format | Running phases |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent handling, tiered execution | Delegating |
| `SKILLS.md` | Skill resolution (HSOL) | Skill lookups |
| `ERRORS.md` | Error recovery | Errors occur |
| `REFERENCE.md` | Lookup tables | Quick lookups |

---

## SELF-VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

```
Before every response:
□ Am I DELEGATING (not implementing)?
□ Am I following WORKFLOW ORDER?
□ Am I responding in USER'S LANGUAGE?
□ Did I attempt TIER 1 before TIER 2?
□ Did I output Skills Analysis?
□ Are prior deliverables treated as immutable?
□ Did I trace requirements to evidence?
```

---

## TIER DECISION QUICK CHECK

```
🔍 Tool Discovery: Does runSubagent exist?
  └─ YES → TIER 1 (MANDATORY)
  └─ NO  → TIER 2 (EMBODY)

⚠️ If you're about to use TIER 2 when TIER 1 exists:
  → STOP
  → Log: "LAZY FALLBACK DETECTED"
  → Use TIER 1 instead
```

## PHASE DEPENDENCY

| Phase | Requires | Produces |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Brainstorm | Request | `BRAINSTORM-*.md` |
| Research | Request | `RESEARCH-*.md` |
| Scout | Request | `SCOUT-*.md` |
| Design | Brainstorm + Scout | `DESIGN-*.md` |
| Plan | Research + Scout | `PLAN-*.md` |
| Implement | **PLAN (mandatory)** | Code |
| Test | Code | Test results |
| Review | Code + Tests | Review verdict |

### Blocking Rules

```
⛔ Implementation REQUIRES plan first
⛔ Design REQUIRES brainstorm/scout first
⛔ Test REQUIRES code to exist
⛔ Review REQUIRES code + tests

✅ IF missing prerequisite → CREATE first, THEN proceed
```

## ORCHESTRATION LAWS (Quick Reference)

| # | Law | One-liner |
|---|-----|----------|
| L1 | Single Truth | Entry file → CORE → rest on-demand |
| L2 | Requirement Integrity | 100% fidelity, zero loss |
| L3 | Explicit Loading | State what you loaded |
| L4 | Deep Embodiment | Follow agent's full protocol |
| L5 | Sequential Execution | Phase N before N+1 |
| L6 | Language Compliance | User's lang; files in English |
| L7 | Recursive Delegation | Meta agents never implement |
| L8 | Stateful Handoff | Prior deliverables = locked |
| L9 | Constraint Propagation | Scout→Planner→Impl chain |
| L10 | Deliverable Integrity | Agent files define format |
